            This is our cutting-edge electric vehicle platform. Notice the
            integrated battery pack right here in the center â€“ it's the heart of
            the system, providing power to the motors. We've got electric motors
            on both axles, making this a true all-wheel-drive vehicle for
            enhanced performance and traction. The bright blue components you
            see are part of the advanced suspension system, designed for a
            smooth and comfortable ride. And of course, you can see the robust
            chassis itself, providing a solid foundation for the entire vehicle.
            This platform represents the future of electric mobility.
