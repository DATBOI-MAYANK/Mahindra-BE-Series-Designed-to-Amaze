            This vehicle is equipped with a comprehensive suite of sensors that
            provide a 360-degree view of its surroundings. Our radar system,
            depicted here, allows the car to "see" long distances, even in
            challenging weather. We also use ultrasonic sensors for close-range
            detection, ideal for parking and maneuvering in tight spaces. And of
            course, cameras provide crucial visual information for features like
            lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control. This advanced
            sensor technology is designed to keep you safe and aware on the
            road.

            Let me show you how our lane keeping assist system works. The car
            uses sensors to monitor the lane markings and detect if you
            unintentionally drift out of your lane. If that happens, the system
            can provide gentle steering input to help you stay on course. It can
            also detect other vehicles in adjacent lanes, alerting you to
            potential hazards. This technology is all about enhancing safety and
            preventing accidents.

            This vehicle features a sophisticated driver monitoring system. It
            uses facial recognition technology to identify the driver and track
            their head and eye movements. This allows the system to detect signs
            of drowsiness or distraction, and provide alerts to help keep the
            driver focused on the road. It's an extra layer of safety designed
            to protect both the driver and other road users.
